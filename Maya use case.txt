	objective: To check if a Train needs repair and reduce human error.

	Central railways implementing a new AI-powerd robort that will regularly check trains in the state to guage their need for repair.

	The robort called USTAAD- Undergear Survillance Through Artificial Intelligence Assisted Droid.
	developed by the mechnical branch of central railways Nagpur division.
	

	DATA.

	It reportedly do work by capturing photos and videos of the vehicles under gears and sending them to engineers

	It exmains parts of trains coach in real time with an HD camera and transmit images taken over wifi.
	
	Enigneers will be able to see videos on big screen and as well record them.

	The cameras of the robot can be rotated in any direction as per command, it can zoom on the spot equipped with LED 
	flood light and able to capture video in low light and even in dark mode.
	

	Conclusion
