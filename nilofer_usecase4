Context: A company wants to determine the impact of R&D investment on company performance. The company has data on the R&D investment of a sample of companies and their return on equity (ROE). The company wants to use data science to analyze the data and find the relationship between R&D investment and ROE.
Objective: To determine the impact of R&D investment on company profitability, as measured by return on equity (ROE).

•	Customer Satisfaction (Score): A score that measures customer satisfaction.
Methods:
•	The company will use a machine learning model to predict the ROE of a company based on its R&D spending.
•	The machine learning model will be trained on a dataset of historical data on R&D spending and ROE.
•	The model will be evaluated on a holdout dataset of data that was not used to train the model.
Conclusion:
•	The results of the analysis will be used to inform the company's decisions about R&D investment.
•	If the analysis shows that R&D investment is positively correlated with ROE, then the company might decide to increase its R&D spending.
